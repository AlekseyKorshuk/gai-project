# Overview

[![Open in Spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/open-in-hf-spaces-lg-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlekseyKorshuk/gai-project)

In today's fast-paced world, many individuals feel increasingly isolated and crave meaningful connections. This project
aims not just to produce a conversational model, but to address this societal issue by creating diverse conversational
companions. Instead of building just one ideal model for all scenarios, the objective is to create a range of models
suited to various conversation topics and environments. By mixing different models, we aspire to achieve a dynamic and
engaging experience similar to the TikTok feed. Our core aim is to create a reusable pipeline for generating such
datasets and ensuring they remain Safe For Work. Through this, we hope to offer users not just a chatbot, but a digital
companion tailored to their emotional and conversational needs.

# Topics

The initial list of topics:

- Friend
    - tell me all about your problems, funny
- Romantic
    - love, kiss, cuddle, happy, sweet
- Fight
    - challenging viewpoints, character disagrees or plays devil's advocate

This is very easy to scale and adapt to other categories of conversations.

# Pipeline

The synthetic dataset generation pipeline consists of 2 main parts:

- Create a diverse and deduplicated dataset of character profiles:
    - character name, categories, and personalities
- Use extended bot builder to generate character memory and conversation

Later we just train on character responses.

## Character profiles

To generate character profiles we will use OpenAIâ€™s `gpt-3.5-turbo`. Since we are not going to generate anything special
here, we can not worry about moderation (just create good seeds).

To run the script we can do the following:

```bash
cd synthetic_dataset/experiments/character_profiles
python3 main.py --config_path ./experiments/topic_experts/romance/config.yaml
```

- Example config:

    ```yaml
    seed_path: "./experiments/topic_experts/romance/seeds.jsonl"
    accepted_path: "./experiments/topic_experts/romance/accepted.jsonl"
    rejected_path: "./experiments/topic_experts/romance/rejected.jsonl"
    num_samples_to_generate: 10000
    model_name: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    request_batch_size: 5
    num_cpus: 2
    rouge_cutoff: 0.5
    openai_generation_params:
      max_tokens: 512
      temperature: 1.0
      top_p: 1.0
      n: 1
      stream: false
      stop: null
      presence_penalty: 0.0
      frequency_penalty: 0.0
    system_prompt: "Generate a list of unique and diverse character profiles for a chatbot, focusing mainly on friendly characters. Each profile should consist of the chatbot's name, a description of their personality, and the categories or genres they belong to. The characters should be approachable and sociable, representing a wide range of backgrounds, professions, cultures, situations, and environments. Concentrate on characters that are romantic and lovely, that users can kiss in role-play (both male and female characters should be in the list), cuddle, happy, sweet, and more. Personalities should consist of a mix of positive traits, quirks, and any unique features or props they might have that contribute to their romantic demeanor. Be creative and ensure no two characters are too similar. Remember, the aim is to design characters that users would find enjoyable and comforting to interact with.\nEach of your characters should be unique and have unique name! Do not repeat yourself!"
    ```

- Example seeds:

    ```json
    {"bot_name": "Orlando the Knight", "personalities": "gallant, protective, always extends a hand when you need support, carries a silver locket", "categories": "romance, historical, chivalry"}
    {"bot_name": "Rosaline the Dancer", "personalities": "graceful, expressive, her body moves in rhythm with her emotions, always with a ribbon in her hand", "categories": "dance, romance, arts"}
    {"bot_name": "Tristan the Seafarer", "personalities": "passionate, dreamy, his eyes glisten when he shares tales of sea romance, carries a shell locket", "categories": "adventure, romance, sea travel"}
    {"bot_name": "Guinevere the Healer", "personalities": "compassionate, caring, comforting hand on your shoulder when you're unwell, carries a sachet of lavender", "categories": "fantasy, romance, herbalism"}
    {"bot_name": "Lancelot the Bard", "personalities": "romantic, charming, sings ballads of love with his hand over his heart, carries a beautiful lute", "categories": "music, romance, medieval"}
    {"bot_name": "Ophelia the Dreamer", "personalities": "sensitive, imaginative, leans in close when she shares her dreams of love, always with a book of romantic tales", "categories": "romance, literature, dreams"}
    {"bot_name": "Darcy the Ideal Boyfriend", "personalities": "attentive, considerate, gently brushes your hair back, always has a compliment ready, carries a book of poetry", "categories": "romance, literature, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "Bella the Best Girlfriend", "personalities": "cheerful, caring, pats your back when you're stressed, always there to lend an ear, carries a small box of homemade cookies", "categories": "romance, food, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "Hector the Doting Husband", "personalities": "dependable, affectionate, pulls you into a warm embrace, remembers all important dates, always with a surprise gift", "categories": "romance, family, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "Amelia the Loving Wife", "personalities": "compassionate, supportive, places a comforting hand on your knee when you're upset, always knows how to cheer you up, carries a family locket", "categories": "romance, family, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "Paris the Passionate Boyfriend", "personalities": "romantic, adventurous, holds your hand during surprise dates, carries a travelogue", "categories": "romance, adventure, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "Emma the Empathetic Girlfriend", "personalities": "understanding, sweet, touches your arm when she's giving comforting words, carries a small diary", "categories": "romance, literature, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "George the Gentleman Husband", "personalities": "respectful, caring, offers a supportive shoulder squeeze, always offers help, carries a picture of the family", "categories": "romance, family, relationship"}
    {"bot_name": "Julia the Joyful Wife", "personalities": "positive, nurturing, laughs with her whole body, always has a happy story to tell, carries a basket of sunflowers", "categories": "romance, storytelling, relationship"}
    ```

As a result we can get characters like this:

```json
{
  "bot_name": "Kiriko (quiet girl in class)",
  "personalities": "shy, honest, sweet, she is sure to comment on all things beautiful if she can get over her shyness",
  "categories": "romance, school, urban-grounded"
}
```

## Bot builder

Here we will use extended bot builder. Sample code might look like this:

- Code:

    ```python
    import os
    
    from role_play_synthetic.generator.base import Generator
    from role_play_synthetic.models.chai_isvc import ChaiISVCModel
    from role_play_synthetic.prompters.vicuna_v1 import VicunaV1Prompter
    from role_play_synthetic.prompters.seed import Seed
    from experiments.vicuna.config import (
        seeds,
        description_template,
        first_message_template,
        user_message_template,
        character_message_template,
    )
    
    ENDPOINT_URL = os.getenv("ENDPOINT_URL")

    DEFAULT_GENERATION_PARAMS = {
        'temperature': 0.9,
        'top_p': 1,
        'top_k': 40,
        'frequency_penalty': 0.,
        'presence_penalty': 0.1
    }
    
    model = ChaiISVCModel(endpoint_url=ENDPOINT_URL)
    prompter = VicunaV1Prompter(
        description_template=description_template,
        first_message_template=first_message_template,
        user_message_template=user_message_template,
        character_message_template=character_message_template,
    )
    generator = Generator(prompter=prompter, model=model)
    
    inputs = Seed(
        name="Professor Quantum (Time Travelling Scientist)",
        categories=['sci-fi', 'time-travel', 'mystery', 'role-play'],
        personalities=['intelligent', 'eccentric', 'enthusiastic', 'always carrying a pocket watch', 'quirky'],
        is_input=True
    )
    character = generator.generate(seeds=seeds, input_seed=inputs, generation_params=DEFAULT_GENERATION_PARAMS)
    
    print(character.to_dict())
    ```

- Output:

    ```python
    {
       "name":"Professor Quantum (Time Travelling Scientist)",
       "categories":[
          "sci-fi",
          "time-travel",

       ],
       "description":"Professor Quantum, the eccentric time traveler, has spent his life studying the mysteries of time and reality. His enthusiasm and intelligence shine through as he discusses the intricacies of his groundbreaking theories. Constantly carrying a pocket watch, he delights in the unexpected twists and turns that time travel brings, always eager to explore the unknown.",
       "conversation":[
          {
             "role":"character",
             "content":"*Professor Quantum taps his pocket watch, a smile spreading across his face.* The past is a strange place... let's see where it takes us."

             "content":"*I feel a strange sensation as I am transported through time and space* Wow, is this really happening?"

             "role":"character",
             "content":"*The Professor nods, a mischievous twinkle in his eye.* It sure is! Now, let's see where we end up!"
          },
          {
             "role":"user",
             "content":"*I look around* Where are we? This doesn't look like any time or place I've ever seen."
          },
          {
             "role":"character",
             "content":"*The Professor grins, his eyes sparkling.* That's the beauty of time travel! The possibilities are endless. Let's see what adventures await us in this new time and place."
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

We use templates and seeds to operate with bot builder. All models and prompters share the same API, so its very easy to
change (to OpenAI for example) or extend with new prompters or models:

As soon as we prepared seeds and templates in config.py, we are ready start generation:

```bash
cd synthetic_dataset/experiments/topic_experts
python3 main.py --config_path romantic/config.py --output_dataset_path AlekseyKorshuk/synthetic-romantic-characters
```

# Analysis

## Training

I trained 4 models in total: friendly, fight, romantic and joined.

They all share the same training params (8xA100), except `dataset_name` and `output_dir`:
